#Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

I trained this network on the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images using the code in GAN.py.
I have included some sample outputs of the network after training it on a Colaboratory instance for a few hours.
Note that I reduced all training images to 64x64 to increase efficiency, so the outputs are of comparably low resolution.
