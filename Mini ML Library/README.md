# C++ Toy Machine Learning Library
In an attempt to learn what was going on behind the scenes of tensorflow, especially when it comes to automatic differentiation,
I built a miniature machine learning library capable of building models consisting of common layer types and using backpropogation
to update weights given training data. During this project, I also researched two more complex methods of automatic differentiation
(dual number differentiation and gradient tape) but did not implement them.
