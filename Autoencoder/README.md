# Image Autoencoder

This autoencoder, in conjunction with a simple K nearest neighbor algorithm, is able to "memorize" a low dimensional
representation of a video and then determine whether the content any given image was in the video. I built this algorithm
in the first stages of my research with professor Benjamin Kuipers at the University of Michigan.
