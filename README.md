# Machine-Learning
Machine learning algorithms in tensorflow and python. Here you will find:

Two word-vector models based on the Word2Vec model
first presented by Mikolov et. al. written in Tensorflow and python 3.5.
One is meant for a larger dataset, the other is meant to run quickly and
efficiently with less data on a CPU.

A multilayer Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) for sequence prediction
used for natural language processing also in Tensorflow and python 2.7

A custom tensorflow wide and deep neural network for classification meant to
be trained on Kaggle's Titanic dataset.

A convolutional neural network in tensorflow 0.12 for image classification.
Made for Kaggle's cat and dog image classification challenge.
