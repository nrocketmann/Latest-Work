# Machine-Learning
Machine learning algorithms in tensorflow and python. Here you will find:

A word-vector model based on the Word2Vec model
first presented by Mikolov et. al. written in Tensorflow and python 3.5

A multilayer Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) for sequence prediction
used for natural language processing also in Tensorflow and python 2.7

A custom tensorflow wide and deep neural network for classification meant to
be trained on Kaggle's Titanic dataset.
