# Some of my Latest Work

I use this repository primarily as a portfolio to exhibit some of the projects I have worked on in the last year. Unfortunately, for the time being, 90% or more of what I work on is under non-disclosure agreements (recently for [Ultraleap](https://ultraleap.com) and [Nobl](https://wearenobl.com)), so very little of what I do makes it into this repository. All of the projects here I put together in my small bits of free time from studies and work.
For my most thorough and interesting side project in the last year, check out the [Drone](Drone) folder, which I worked on over summer 2020 alongside my job at Ultraleap.
